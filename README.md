   ## Description:

My final project is a Connect-4 game that you may play at the terminal.
When run it first's display a intro
## Intro:
wich you may press '[1] [2] [r] [q]'
'[1]' Will display to you an one Vs one game of Connect-4
'[2]' Will display to you an Battle Royal game of Connect-4
'[r]' Will display to you how to play the game, in case you do not know
'[q]' Will quit the program

### '[1]' One Vs One
This mode will display to you a grid with 8 blocks of width and 6 blocks of height, the header of this grid is a display
with **|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|**, in witch you can not play with. To play you are suppost to pick one colum **|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|**, press
the number of the colum that you want and press enter. When done-it you will be displayed by a new grid with your piece in the lowest place, because,
as the game in real life, the piece fall. Now it is time for your oponent do the same.

### '[2]' Battle Royale
First, this mode will prompt the user the amount of players that will play (min players = 2; max players = 6). When written and pressed enter
the game will start. And for now one it is equal to the '[1] One Vs One' game mode, but there is more players.

### How to win the game?
Your task as a player is to build a **row** or a **column** or a **diagonal** with your pieces. like this:

### Why I choose this project?
My little brother is 6 years old and he is in that fase that everithing he sees he wants,
so a couple days later he was playing at his friends house the Connect-4 and enjoy-it a lot.
When he arrived home he asked if I have the game to play with him, but unfortinally I do not,
that is why i create this game. To play with my little brother.
